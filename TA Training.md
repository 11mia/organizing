* **Review the RailsBridge teacher training slides.**

* **Determine how TAs should approach students, taking into account the layout of your classroom.** 

  For example, if your classroom space is large enough to do so, it's usually preferable to seat students in clusters, which help facilitate discussion. In this case, it's best to divide the TAs, (informally) assigning them to assist a cluster or two at a time. 

  However, if your classroom has tables arranged in rows facing forward, it may be preferable to have TAs seated amongst the students; having TAs along the edges of the rows will make them less approachable, and having TAs walk along the rows could block students' view of the instructor.
