Jane Sebastian and I (Lillie Chilen) are overhauling the RailsBridge.org website. It will be in a [repo under my name](https://github.com/lilliealbert/site_de_railsbridge_2013) until we're ready to get larger feedback on it, at which point, we'll bring it over to the official RailsBridge repo.

Here's where it lives currently: [sleepy-atoll-6384.herokuapp.com](http://sleepy-atoll-6384.herokuapp.com/).

### Goals

We have some goals for this, including:

* Site should be version controlled and updates should happen via pull requests on a GitHub repo
* Site should look good and be easy to navigate
* Include blog, calendar, donation functionality (blog will likely live on WordPress)
* Live Twitter feed on homepage
* Quick access to workshop materials / curriculum
* Volunteer/organizer interest form
* Clearer path for workshop "grads" who want to get involved

### Process

Jane and I are going to work with a few UX / visual design folks to get feedback on what we have so far.

### Outstanding Questions

* What's the relationship between this site and Bridge Troll? 
* How can we use the Bridge Troll workshop data (historical & new), so things become dynamic moving forward?

### Non-MVP Wish List

* Google map visualization of all past workshops
* Ongoing (non-workshop specific) feedback loop for students & volunteers

### Resources

* Patrick Leahy did a bunch of visual design work for Bridge Troll. The top mockup [on this page](http://www.behance.net/gallery/Bridge-Troll/7259123) didn't work out for Bridge Troll, but is good inspiration for a new RailsBridge.org home page.
