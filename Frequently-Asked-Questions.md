## Do workshop organizers and teaching staff need to be women?

For a workshop intending to introduce women to programming, ideally,
there should be a strong presence of women both on the teaching staff
and amongst the organizers. Given that, ClojureBridge exists to
address an imbalance in the Clojure community, so a diverse teaching
staff may not be possible in certain geographic areas.

Even though the first workshop couldn't make good gender balance on
the teaching staff, the second, third, etc. workshop may solve
this. Continuing to organize will help make change in your
community. Some ways to maximise the presence of women in the running
of a ClojureBridge workshop are:

1. Invite local organisations for women in tech to advise/co-organise
   the event.
2. Would any women you know who program in languages other than
   Clojure consider learning enough to be a TA? This is particularly
   useful if they have previous experience teaching at a similar event
   like RailsBridge, Django Girls etc.
3. Are there women Clojure developers living in neighbouring cities
   who could help? (offer to pay their travel costs if possible).
4. Is there a Clojure/FP conference in your region which you could
   schedule ClojureBridge close to, so that conference delegates can
   volunteer?
5. If there's been a previous ClojureBridge near you, are there former
   students who could become TAs?
6. Make the most of the women you have, giving them leading roles in
   teaching and presenting

Ultimately, it's important to be proactive about creating a diverse
environment where possible, and that the environment created by a
ClojureBridge workshop be inclusive of all participants.


## Who can attend to workshops? Men are allowed?
