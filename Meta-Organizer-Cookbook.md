SF meta-organizers are Lillie Chilen and Rachel Myers. This is how we roll.

## What's a meta-organizer?

A meta-organizer finds workshop organizers and venues so that lots of workshops can happen in a given locale. Since we have 1-2 workshops a month in San Francisco, we spread out who's doing the heavy lifting of running each workshop.

## How we meta-organize in San Francisco

In SF, we have a spreadsheet that lists out our prospective organizers / venues, the status of each upcoming workshop, and which of us was responsible for making sure that worskhop took place. This helps us keep track of who's doing what, where, when.

### Workflow:

* At least once per quarter, get together to brainstorm and send emails.
* Comb through the past volunteer and organizer lists to see who might be willing to organize again or for the first time.
* Look through our list of companies who have previously offered to host or that we have contacts at and decide who to ask.
* Send out a bunch of emails to potential organizers and venues.
* Follow up with those who have questions or are up for it.
* Connect volunteers and venues to pick a date for their workshop.

## Strategies for Recruiting Organizers

The path often looks something like: student --> TA --> teacher --> organizer, but that's very rough and often steps are skipped. Lots of teachers don't start off as students, for instance, and sometime students are ready to jump right into organizing!

### Places to look for organizers

* Look at your recent volunteers list, and see if you have repeat volunteers. These folks might be up for stepping into the organizer role for a workshop.
* At the beginning of the workshop, announce that there will be a table at lunch of people talking about organizing a workshop if anyone is interested in that.
* Ask! And when you ask, ask for nominations as well. They might know someone perfect.
