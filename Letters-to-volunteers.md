> (VOLUNTEER SURVEY LINK)
> 
> THANK YOU.

> Any questions, let me or Jessie know.

> PS: I'm going to assume non-survey participation means you can't make it, not to be super harsh or anything. And as always: In the spirit of maintaining a safe and comfortable learning environment, we expect everyone who attends to behave professionally.
