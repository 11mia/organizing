## When You Sign Up

### <a name="joinlistserve"/>Join the organizer's listserve
If you haven't already, join: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/railsbridge-workshops. You can email the list with questions, requests, panic, or jokes. We're all here to help. 

### <a name="confirmvenue"/>Confirm dates & details with the hosting venue
The Railsbridge meta-organizers have introduced you via email to the contact person at the venue. You'll want to confirm that the dates still work for them, how much room they have (which you will use to guide the RSVP cap on Bridge Troll), and lots of other details. So many, in fact, that we have a whole separate page: [[hosting venue questions|hosting venue questions]].

### <a name="calendarlisting'/>Add your workshop to the RailsBridge website calendar
You can announce your workshop on the listserve or contact Isa at miss.herico at gmail dot com.

### <a name="meetmentor"/>Meet your mentor
If this is your first time organizing, the meta-organizers will set you up with a mentor to answer questions as they arise. Say hello now, in person or in the ether!

### <a name="bridgetroll"/>Post the event on Bridge Troll

Bridge Troll is the RailsBridge-specific event management system we use to help Organizers have a better time. Visit [bridgetroll.herokuapp.com](http://bridgetroll.herokuapp.com), create an account, and make a new event by choosing "Organize an Event" in the bottom left.

Copy an old workshop, update the details with your own, and have someone else read through it before posting. Because most people forget to update at least one piece of information, to various levels of tragedy.

Bridge Troll can be used to
 * Record RSVPs for Students and Volunteers, including self-selected class level preferences
 * Email all students or volunteers
 * Record check-ins of students and volunteers on Installfest and Workshop days
 * Arrange students and volunteers into small groups on the day of the event

### <a name="meetup"/>Post the event on Meetup.com
If your workshop is in SF, contact Bosco & Caleb for organizer permission via [sfruby.info/suggestion](http://www.sfruby.info/suggestion/), so you can post to the [SF Ruby Meetup](http://sfruby.info). You will create:
* A workshop
* A teacher training (can be scheduled closer to event)

The workshop event you post on Meetup should be for publicity purposes **ONLY**. Set the RSVP limit to 1 (just you) and link to the Bridge Troll event for people to do their actual sign ups. If Meetup doesn't have a lot of use in your area, you can avoid making the Meetup event and try to get the word out in another way.

_Continue to send pings to your attendees through Meetup about Downloading & Installing Xcode so everyone's ready for Installfest._

> Todo: Post Meetup event templates

### <a name="survey"/>Survey the students and volunteers
The pre-workshop survey helps gauge who actually plans on coming and what class levels they will be in. 

> Todo: Post a survey email template

Eventually Bridge Troll will take a greater part in the pre/post workshop survey, but until then our current Google Doc templates can be found and used. In order to not expose your attendee's email address and infos to the entire Internet, **please copy the form (File -> Make a copy...).** Send your students a link to the form created by your copy, and share a link to your spreadsheet  with the workshop coordinators (the ones who set you up with the venue originally, probably Lillie or Rachel in SF) so they can add the info to a private cumulative spreadsheet. 

You can use Bridge Troll to email the survey all the participants of various RSVP statuses (yes & waitlist being the most important).

Here is the form to copy: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Al9a5yeo4q0AdElLRHVuWFpDdGxqb3BVajE5dUF2THc

### It bears repeating: please COPY this form before sending it to your students, so their responses aren't available to anyone who clicks on the link directly preceding this sentence.

The same is all true for the volunteer survey: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Al9a5yeo4q0AdFJZTlFxSkZWS2ZRRmI4c3FXVnJXMUE#gid=0

### <a name="catering"/>Arrange catering

David at Triptych has catered many RailsBridge workshops and is super easy to work with. He has a standard menu for us that is both in our budget and deliciously accommodates all the diets (vegetarian, vegans and gluten free). To order food from Triptych, give them a few weeks notice, and email david (at) triptychsf.com with something like this:

> Hi David,
>
> My name is [Sarah]. I'm organizing a RailsBridge Workshop. RailsBridge gave me your contact information and said Triptych had catered several workshops in the past. We're having a workshop on [Saturday, August 11], and we've scheduled lunch for [12:30]. It's set for the [IGN office] at [500 2nd Street]. 
>
> We're expecting [100] people, but RailsBridge suggested that we should give a smaller head count of [75% of the expected headcount]. As usual, we need a menu that accommodates vegans, vegetarians and gluten-free diets. I'm ccing my co-organizer, [Samantha], and including both our phone numbers below for when you need us the morning of. Do you think that will work?

> Thanks,
> You

You can also pick your own caterer, we have [[some suggestions|SF Catering and after party location suggestions]]! In which case, as you are getting quotes for the catering, check out the [[sample budget|sample budget]]. Totals will vary depending on the number of folks there and where you're getting the food, but you shouldn't spend more than $1,500 for the whole workshop.

### Here are some [[SF Catering and after party location suggestions]]!

### Installfest
Installfest food is pizza and hopefully salad. If the host has a beer fridge or kegerator to share, that's awesome, otherwise, get some beer, too. 

Amounts: 2-3 slices of pizza (20 inch) for each anticipated individual. 
(I.e. Total Volunteers + Attendees = 80, 60% = 48: Roughly 144 slices needed- so 9 pizzas with 16 slices)

### Breakfast
Workshop breakfast is usually coffee & bagels. Arrange to have everything delivered about 15 minutes before Volunteers arrive, so there is food and coffee to greet them.

Noah’s Bagels has a great catering delivery service on bagels. Order enough bagels to cover about 70% of attendees/volunteers with ‘Yes’ RSVP.  If you order hot sandwiches, let them know when you order to cut in halves and wrapped individually.  They're happy to oblige & it makes setup that much faster for you.
 
Search around the workshop’s location to find a coffee shop which will deliver it to you, if possible.  Not everyone will drink, but make sure to have plenty as many will refill their cups throughout the day. Remember to request extra cups & cream.
(Coffee Bean has a reasonable one which includes sugar, milk, disposable cups etc. A Cambro (5 gallons) is usually MORE than enough for 70 people as not everyone will drink coffee.)

### Lunch

Ask the host location if they have any recommendations for catering companies that they have used before. 
Give the Caterer estimated head count; usually 70% of that number of Yes RSVPs. Ask for a Vegetarian/Vegan option for about a third of the food, and if they will want help clearing away any of the set-up they bring. 

If the host company is not paying for it, ask for a quote to submit to Austin for approval. 

If lunch will be delivered, please make sure they come at least 30 minutes beforehand so you & your team have time to set up.  When setting up, try to make sure the food is accessible by many at the same time (perhaps various stations?) as lunch time goes by so fast.

### <a name="afterparty"/>Make after-party reservations
It’s always great to thank volunteers for their time and help with a free drink after the event. This also gives the workshop goers a chance to socialize more and really build some networking connections that will help support them if they decide they now have the bug and want to actually delve into this awesome world of Ruby programming!

Find someplace close. The closer the after-party is to the workshop site, the more likely it is that people won’t get lost or distracted between workshop and party. A deserted bar is ideal, a casual restaurant is also good. Most workshops end at 4:30 or so on Saturdays, which tends to be a slow time for bars and restaurants, but it pays to check.

Make arrangements with the location ahead of time. If you can tell a place that X many people will be coming and you will buy Y many drinks (one for each of your volunteers), that’s often enough to encourage them to go out of their way to support what you’re doing. Some places will offer specials (free drinks, extra food) to entice large groups but even those that don’t should be informed before a horde of people descend on them.

Mention the after-party early and often. The more times you mention the fact and location of the after party the less likely it is that people don’t come because they don’t know about it.

If a potential host demands a minimum bar tab or rental fee, go elsewhere! Plenty of places don’t, but some places are in the business of hosting parties. This tends to run $1000 and up, which is too expensive unless you have an after-party sponsor.

###  <a name="trainteachers"/>Train the teachers
Set up a teacher training. This often happens during the week of the workshop. If you can't get a separate evening, you can do it during the Installfest, but try to get extra volunteers if you do that. Don't want to leave the student high and dry while teachers discuss best practices. 

Take a look at the teacher training slides, which live at [http://curriculum.railsbridge.org/workshop/teacher_training](http://curriculum.railsbridge.org/workshop/teacher_training). Edit them as appropriate here: [https://github.com/railsbridge/workshop/blob/master/teachers/teacher_training.md](https://github.com/railsbridge/workshop/blob/master/teachers/teacher_training.md). 

### <a name="communicate"/>Communicate with everyone
A few of the things you'll do:
* Post/announce the workshop to the RubySF Meetup mailing list
* Email the pre-workshop survey to the attendees, optionally including a deadline to respond
* Remind attendees to take the pre-workshop survey
* Remind attendees that if they have a Mac, they will need XCode prior to arriving to the Installfest
* Email the volunteer survey to the volunteers
* Send Installfest instructions to attendees 
* Send logistical info (detailed schedule, parking info, etc.) 
* Ask people at every turn to update their RSVP on Meetup.com if they can't come

When people join the SF Ruby meetup to attend a workshop, they don't always realize that by default they will be getting the Ruby-6 mailing list into their inbox. In one of your emails, it's helpful to address that and explain where the email setting are or encourage them to filter the messages (but still pay attention! for future learning!). 

You can find templates for emails in the [[materials section|materials]] under "Communication".


### <a name="childcare"/>Arrange childcare
* Anecdotally, few people take you up on childcare; more people tend to use nursing/pumping space, actually.
* It's worth checking with the people who said they needed childcare to make sure they still really do.
* We have a list of contact info for sitters; email the workshop mailing list (which you should already be subscribed to!) at https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/railsbridge-workshops for access.

### <a name="objects"/>Obtain necessary objects: power cords, flash drives, name tags, etc.
> To do: develop physical items plans (#1 plan: don't lose the stuff)

### <a name="slides"/>Update the pre- and post-workshop presentation slides
* Templates and instructions live in [[Templates and Materials|Templates and Materials]]

### <a name="levels"/>Figure out student class levels
* Use the [[grouping guide|Class level grouping guide]] to interpret the results of the pre-workshop survey
