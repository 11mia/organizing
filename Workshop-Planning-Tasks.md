## When You Sign Up

### <a name="joinlistserve"/>Join the organizer's listserve
If you haven't already, join: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/railsbridge-workshops. You can email the list with questions, requests, panic, or jokes. We're all here to help. 

### <a name="confirmvenue"/>Confirm dates & details with the hosting venue
The Railsbridge meta-organizers have introduced you via email to the contact person at the venue. You'll want to confirm that the dates still work for them, how much room they have (which you will use to guide the RSVP cap on Meetup), and lots of other details. So many, in fact, that we have a whole separate page: [[hosting venue questions|hosting venue questions]].

### <a name="meetmentor"/>Meet your mentor
If this is your first time organizing, the meta-organizers will set you up with a mentor to answer questions as they arise. Say hello now, in person or in the ether!

## Six Weeks Before

### <a name="meetup"/>Post the event on Meetup.com
Contact Bosco & Caleb for organizer permission via [sfruby.info/suggestion](http://www.sfruby.info/suggestion/), so you can post to the [SF Ruby Meetup](http://sfruby.info). You will create:
* A student event
* A volunteer event
* A teacher training (can be scheduled closer to event)

_Continue to send pings to your attendees through Meetup about Downloading & Installing XCODE so everyone's ready for Installfest._

Copy an old workshop, update the details with your own, and have someone else read through it before posting. Because most people forget to update at least one piece of information, to various levels of tragedy.

> Todo: Post Meetup event templates

## Two Weeks Before

### <a name="survey"/>Survey the students and volunteers
The pre-workshop survey helps gauge who actually plans on coming and what class levels they will be in. 

> Todo: Post a survey email template

While there is a project currently underway for a site that allows organizers to easily send volunteers and attendees questionnaire forms, our current Google Doc templates can be found and used. In order to not expose your attendee's email address and infos to the entire Internet, **please copy the form (File -> Make a copy...).** Send your students a link to the form created by your copy, and share a link to your spreadsheet  with the workshop coordinators (the ones who set you up with the venue originally, probably Lillie or Rachel in SF) so they can add the info to a private cumulative spreadsheet. 

Meetup likes privacy. So you don't have access to folks' email addresses. You can, however, email all the participants of various RSVP statuses (yes & waitlist being the most important).

Here is the form to copy: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Al9a5yeo4q0AdElLRHVuWFpDdGxqb3BVajE5dUF2THc

### It bears repeating: please COPY this form before sending it to your students, so their responses aren't available to anyone who clicks on the link directly preceding this sentence.

The same is all true for the volunteer survey: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Al9a5yeo4q0AdFJZTlFxSkZWS2ZRRmI4c3FXVnJXMUE#gid=0

### <a name="catering"/>Arrange catering

David at Triptych has catered many RailsBridge workshops and is super easy to work with. He has a standard menu for us that is both in our budget and deliciously accommodates all the diets (vegetarian, vegans and gluten free). To order food from Triptych, give them a few weeks notice, and email david (at) triptychsf.com with something like this:

> Hi David,
>
> My name is [Sarah]. I'm organizing a RailsBridge Workshop. RailsBridge gave me your contact information and said Triptych had catered several workshops in the past. We're having a workshop on [Saturday, August 11], and we've scheduled lunch for [12:30]. It's set for the [IGN office] at [500 2nd Street]. 
>
> We're expecting [100] people, but RailsBridge suggested that we should give a smaller head count of [75% of the expected headcount]. As usual, we need a menu that accommodates vegans, vegetarians and gluten-free diets. I'm ccing my co-organizer, [Samantha], and including both our phone numbers below for when you need us the morning of. Do you think that will work?

> Thanks,
> You

You can also pick your own caterer, we have [[some suggestions|SF Catering and after party location suggestions]]! In which case, as you are getting quotes for the catering, check out the [[sample budget|sample budget]]. Totals will vary depending on the number of folks there and where you're getting the food, but you shouldn't spend more than $1,500 for the whole workshop.
