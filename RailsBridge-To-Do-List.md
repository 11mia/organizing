## Coding things:

* We have a Tracker backlog of lots of things that would make the RailsBridge web presence better: https://www.pivotaltracker.com/projects/710609. Some of them are easy, some are harder, any would be a huge help.

## Communication things:

* We could use better materials for a quick intro to organizing. The cookbook is great for all the details, but a less threatening introduction would be great.
* I made a Git/Hub one page pull request guide that I would love help expanding: http://railsbridge.github.com/bridge_troll/. Suggestions? Send ‘em my way (lillie.chilen@gmail.com).
* Blogging. We need bloggers. Can you blog about something (or anything even tangentially) related to RailsBridge?
* It would be fantastic to have a topic/skills roadmap for the RoR ecosystem (and the Railsbridge curricula in particular). Ping the mailing list if you’re interested in working on that!

## Curriculum things:

* There are JavaScript, Git, and iOS curricula in the works. Want to help with those, or write a new one? Join the workshop Google group and introduce yourself!
* Some folks have discussed merging the Boston RailsBridge repo with the main RailsBridge repo. If you’d like to help with that, ping the Google group.
* We need to rename our various curricula, because “Intro Rails” and “Intermediate Rails” gets really confusing when you have class levels that include the word Intermediate.

## Other projects:

* Bridge Troll - our fun open source event management software project is chugging along, and we could use help with coding, documentation, bug testing, and UX!
* Bridge Foundry
