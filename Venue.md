The venue for your workshop should have the following:
* Wireless internet access
* An open area large enough to fit all participants (for the Installfest and intro/closing presentations)
* Spaces for small groups 
 * This could be meeting rooms, lounges, or any nook that is a little sequestered from other people.

Ideally, your small groups will have access to a white board or large sticky notes or some way of writing information on the board. They should also have a projector or monitor to look at things together, but if you have to pick between being able to write notes on the board and seeing a screen, choose writing notes.
