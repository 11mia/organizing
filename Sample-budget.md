The main expense is catering, but you'll also need a few supplies (marker pens, nametags). Here are some figures from a previous workshop to give you an idea of how much to budget.  (All currency US$)

## Catering for 60 people
* Totals about $1,000 to $1,200
* $200 for Installfest pizza & beer. Typical order: nine large pizzas (at least three cheese and/or vegetarian), sliced into sixteen pieces; one case of beer.
* $100 for coffee for workshop morning
* $500-700 for Saturday lunch from a catering service/restaurant
 * Getting food from a grocery store like Whole Foods is way cheaper than hiring a restaurant. I ordered 70 pounds of food (a variety of pasta and regular salads and hummus) for a workshop with about 100 students and volunteers. The total came to $584 and there were leftovers.
* $300 for workshop after-party with drinks and tip for 25 volunteers
 * If you have extra money, it's nice to get some appetizers to share.


It's helpful to find a space that has the necessary tables/chairs so that you don't have to worry about renting those.
