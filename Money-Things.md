Money! It's so fun! Or not, depending. Workshops can require dealing with some of it, so here's how we roll.

## Tax-deductible Donations

RailsBridge is a project of Bridge Foundry, which is part of School Factory, a 501c(3). This means we can accept tax-deductible donations! There are two main paths for this: PayPal and snail mail checks. For the organizers, this means that you'll cover the initial expense, and submit the receipts for reimbursement.

Obviously putting $1,200 on a credit card isn't something everyone can do. We've discussed issuing pre-paid check cards to organizers to use for their workshop. We haven't done it yet, but if this is something you think would make organizing better for you, get in touch with one of the members of the finance team and we'll see what we can work out.

## In-kind Donations

It can be super convenient to have your sponsors order the food directly, so that you don't have to deal with reimbursement. Ask them if they'd be up for that!

## Getting Reimbursed



### Finance Team



## Sample Budget 

The main expense is catering, but you'll also need a few supplies (pens, nametags). Here are some figures from a previous workshop to give you an idea of how much to budget. This menu totals about $1,000 to $1,200 (all currency US$).

### Catering for 60
* $200 for Installfest pizza & beer. Typical order: nine large pizzas (at least three cheese and/or vegetarian), sliced into sixteen pieces; one case of beer.
* $100 for coffee for workshop morning
* $500-700 for Saturday lunch from a catering service/restaurant
 * Getting food from a grocery store like Whole Foods is way cheaper than hiring a restaurant. I ordered 70 pounds of food (a variety of pasta and regular salads and hummus) for a workshop with about 100 students and volunteers. The total came to $584 and there were leftovers.
* $300 for workshop after-party with drinks and tip for 25 volunteers
 * If you have extra money, it's nice to get some appetizers to share.

### Other Expenses
* Name tags and pens shouldn't cost you more than $30.
* The Installfest instructions tell students to get a sticker from a volunteer when their install has been checked. You'll want to procure stickers from your sponsor if possible, otherwise star stickers work just fine.
* It's helpful to find a space that has the necessary tables/chairs so that you don't have to worry about renting those.
