Money! It's so fun! Or not, depending. Workshops can require dealing with some of it, so here's how we roll. (We try to avoid dealing with money by having sponsors order food directly, but that's not always possible. Such is life.)

## Sample Budget 

The main expense is catering, but you'll also need a few supplies (pens, nametags). Here are some figures from a previous workshop to give you an idea of how much to budget. This menu totals about $1,000 to $1,200 (all currency US$).

### Catering for 60
* $200 for Installfest pizza & beer.
* $150 for coffee + bagels for workshop morning
* $500-700 for Saturday lunch from a catering service/restaurant
* $300 for workshop after-party with drinks and tip for 25 volunteers
 * If you have extra money, it's nice to get some appetizers to share.

### Other Expenses
* Name tags and pens shouldn't cost you more than $30.
* The Installfest instructions tell students to get a sticker from a volunteer when their install has been checked. You'll want to procure stickers from your sponsor if possible, otherwise star stickers work just fine.
* It's helpful to find a space that has the necessary tables/chairs so that you don't have to worry about renting those.
