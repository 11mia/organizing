ClojureBridge likes to play things fast and loose. Therefore, we don't have a lot of formal organizational structures. If you're wondering who to talk to about stuff regarding ClojureBridge, this is something of a starting place. 

Please join & send any questions to the [workshop organizer's listserve/Google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/clojurebridge-workshops). We all like being in the loop, and those that don't subscribe to the daily digest :D
