## What makes a workshop a ClojureBridge Workshop?
* A commitment by the organizers, teachers, and students to increasing diversity in tech. You can see what that looks like by reading our ["Resources on Diversity" page](https://github.com/ClojureBridge/organizing/wiki/Resources-on-Diversity), or by reading how we typically describe ClojureBridge workshops to attendees:
> This workshop is for women interested in learning programming with Clojure, an expressive, general-purpose programming language. Men, you are welcome if you know a woman who would like to attend and come to learn Clojure together.  ClojureBridge is emphatically queer and trans\* friendly.

* It's free!
* An Installfest in which participants end up with a functional development environment on their machines.
* A Workshop day in which participants do hands-on work on some kind of curriculum.

## The Bare Necessities
Hereâ€™s what you need for a minimum viable workshop:
* A space
* Teachers
* Participants
* Teacher Training (as late as during the Installfest)
* Installfest (Friday night)
* Workshop (Saturday day)

Any number of factors can decide the size of the workshop: the size of the space, the number of teachers available, or the number students interested. If you're striking out on your own, start small and get bigger.

## Finding or Starting an Ecosystem
Workshops need to be part of an ecosystem to be successful. It seems to work best when there is a community, events, and resources available locally. For Clojure and women, regular in-person meetings seem to make a big difference. If there isn't already a monthly meetup, plan to start one after the workshop. If you have a large enough community and a founding team with stamina, plan a series of workshops, so that workshop graduates can come back and TA the next workshop. Learn, understand, practice, teach is a powerful sequence. Women often respond to need more than self-promotion; what they won't do for themselves, they will often do for a like-minded community.
