## What makes a workshop a Railsbridge Workshop?
* A commitment by the organizers, teachers, and students to increasing diversity in tech.
* An Installfest in which participants end up with a functional development environment on their machines.
* A Workshop day in which participants do hands-on work on some kind of curriculum.

## The Bare Necessities 
Hereâ€™s what you need for a minimum viable workshop:
* A space
* Teachers
* Participants 
* Teacher Training (as late as during the Installfest)
* Installfest (Friday night)
* Workshop (Saturday day)

Any number of factors can decide the size of the workshop: the size of the space, the number of teachers available, or the number students interested. If you're striking out on your own, start small and get bigger.
