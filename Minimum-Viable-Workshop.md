## What makes a workshop a Railsbridge Workshop?
* A commitment by the organizers, teachers, and students to increasing diversity in tech.
* An Installfest in which participants end up with a functional development environment on their machines.
* A Workshop day in which participants do hands-on work on some kind of curriculum.

## The Bare Necessities 
Hereâ€™s what you need for a minimum viable workshop:
* A space
* Teachers
* Participants 
* Teacher Training (as late as during the Installfest)
* Installfest (Friday night)
* Workshop (Saturday day)

Any number of factors can decide the size of the workshop: the size of the space, the number of teachers available, or the number students interested. If you're striking out on your own, start small and get bigger. 

## Finding or Starting an Ecosystem
Workshops need to be part of an ecosystem to be successful. It seems to work best when there is a community, events, and resources available locally. For Ruby and women, regular in-person meetings seem to make a big difference. If there isn't already a monthly meetup, plan to start one after the workshop. If you have a large enough community and a founding team with stamina, plan a series of workshops, so that workshop graduates can come back an TA the next workshop. Learn, understand, practice, teach is a powerful sequence. Women often respond to need more than self-promotion; what they won't do for themselves, they will often do for a like-minded community.
