## (Draft)
## Who should we accept as students for the workshop?
- Men can attend?
- How to accept students of underrepresented groups only? Say, only women?

This document shows the guidance whether we should accept men as students for ClojureBridge workshop or not.
Also, this document shows the ideas how to avoid subscribers who don't belong to particular groups for ClojureBridge.
For example, how to accept only female students.

What written here is the __guidance__, which won't force all ClojureBridge workshops to follow.
In any case, the final decision is in organizers' hand.
When organizers can't decide they should accept men for the workshop or not, this document will help them what to do.


### Think what is ClojureBridge's goal

ClojureBridge has been started to diverse Clojure community.
ClojureBridge is for people who belong to underrepresented groups such as women, trans**, genderqueer, or gender non-conforming.
There may be other groups we should identify as underrepresented in Clojure community.

Given that, please do not accept men simply because there are available seats.

Success of a workshop is not a number of attendees but satisfaction of attendees.


### Think how ClojureBridge attendees feel during a workshop

We have heard positive voices from female attendees of women only workshops.
They liked comfortable atmosphere. They didn't feel fear to ask questions during the workshop.
This shows that female only workshops worked as a safe space for them.

Please be very careful when organizers accept men.
The workshop may give uncomfortable feeling to female attendees.


### How to accept men's attendees

ClojureBridge suggests to accept male attendees as guests of female attendees.
A female attendee may bring a man who is a Clojure or programming beginner.

Or, on the contrary, male attendees must come with female guests, would be another rule.

In any case, ClojureBridge wants to avoid decreasing the ratio of attendees from underrepresented groups.


### When organizers may accept men, please...

Please do not write *for women* in anywhere of the workshop announcements.
There may be subscribers because the workshop is *for women*.
What if such attendees see men in the workshop?
This could be considered as betrayal.

Once the announcements said *for women*, please don't change the policy.


### How to enforce or check all subscribers are women

Organizers decided they would accept only female attendees.
But, how can it be possible?

Guessing from name is very tricky and never works perfectly.
Especially, a foreign name is hard to figure out whether the subscriber is he or she.

Some workshops added a checkbox to a registration form, which required "yes" to
the question, "I identify as a woman, trans*, genderqueer, and/or gender non-conforming person."
The organizers said this worked well.

Be prepared beforehand.
