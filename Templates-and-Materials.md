### Post Workshop Survey - (as of 4/2014, this is now handled by BridgeTroll from the Organizer's console)
* [Post-workshop feedback survey](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Al9a5yeo4q0AdDhDZC04Nmx6UnlGZmd5OUlGYmh0ZkE#gid=0)

You should probably take the previous workshop's survey and paste it into a different sheet (look along the bottom if you haven't used sheets in spreadsheets before). Again, this links to the **spreadsheet**, not the forms itself. Don't send this link to your students. 

### Miscellania
* [[Hosting venue questions]]
* [[Class level grouping guide]]
* [[SF Catering and after party location suggestions]]
* [[Sample Budget]]
* [Wrap-up flyer](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/55826860/RailsBridge/more-resources-flyer.pdf) modeled after Lillie's hand-drawn one
* [Quoteable comments for marketing](Quotable-Comments)

## Old Stuff

[Bridge Troll](http://www.bridgetroll.org/) handles most of the communications for workshops at this point; only the post-workshop survey needs to still be sent out using Google Docs. Pre-workshop surveys are included in the RSVP process in Bridge Troll. Most of the content of this section is unnecessary if you're using Bridge Troll.

### Old Stuff

* [[Announcement Templates]] For Meetup
* [[Letters to students]] 
 * Seven emails from Take the Survey to Final Logistics

These are direct links to spreadsheets & forms that you can use as a template. **You must COPY THESE DOCS before using them to avoid exposing your student's or volunteer's data to anyone who click on these links.**
