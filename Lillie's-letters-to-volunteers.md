# Lillie's letters to volunteers

### Here is an email in which I send the wrong survey link to the volunteers. I sent this the Sunday before the workshop.

> Subject: March Railsbridge volunteer survey - for real.
>
> Volunteers! You are the best. No, really.
> 
> Can you take a quick survey so I know when you'll be helping & what you want to do? 
> 
> https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dDhBejF5RzB6Z09lS3FQMUVtY3RjaVE6MQ#gid=0
> 
> THANK YOU.
> 
> Any questions, let me or Jessie know. 
> 
> Best,
> 
> Lillie 
> 
> PS: I'm going to assume non-survey participation means you can't make it, not to be super harsh or anything. 

### And this is what I sent when I realized I've sent the wrong survey.

> Subject: How utterly embarassing
> 
> I sent you the student survey. 
> 
> Here is the correct survey: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dG45NFpfM1BQdkRtbWxNSDF2dm5HTFE6MQ#gid=0
> 
> Ashamedly,
> 
> Lillie
