# Sara's letters to volunteers

###  Volunteer Teacher Training E-Mail

> Hello all you wonderful Volunteers!
> For those of you who are interested in Teaching for this workshop, or who have never Volunteered at a workshop, we encourage you to come to the Teacher Training that we'll be holding at Insert location and time.
> If possible, provide a google map
> Some of the resources we will be looking at during the training are listed below, in case any of you would like to start looking at those now.
> Hopefully this will help everyone prepare for teaching and TAing your classes.
> 
> TEACHING RESOURCES:
> This page contains links to slides that can be used to teach Intro to Programming for Beginners and Intro to Ruby for programmers.  http://www.wiki.devchix.com/index.php?title=Workshop_Topics
> Please look both over and pay close attention to whichever is appropriate for the level you would like to teach or TA on Saturday.
> 
> CURRICULUM:
> Please take some time to look over and step through the curriculum on your own before class.  If you are put in classes with Beginners, you may not get through everything- which is perfectly fine.  
> You can find the curriculum here:
> http://www.wiki.devchix.com/index.php?title=Rails_3_Curriculum
> If you find any areas of the curriculum that don't work, please let me know.
> Before reporting any curriculum errors, please make sure you have the same versions of Ruby, Rails, Gems, etc installed as the curriculum and students are using.
> 
> Thanks again for volunteering to help out!

### Post-Teacher Training E-mail

> Hello Workshop Volunteers!
> 
> We had a great teacher/TA training last night, and I wanted to share some of the resources we looked at during training, as well as the links you'll need to look at for this weekend.    
> Hopefully this will help you all prepare for teaching and TAing your classes.  Please let me know if you need other materials that would be helpful. If you have other materials you think your fellow volunteers would like, please post in the meetup comments.
> 
> CURRICULUM:
> We HIGHLY recommend running through the curriculum yourself before the workshop.  Whether you're teaching or TA'ing, it's good to already be familiar with the basic curriculum, as it will help you prepare for any questions/problems that may come up.   You can find the curriculum here:
> http://www.wiki.devchix.com/index.php?title=Rails_3_Curriculum
> If you find any areas of the curriculum that don't work, please let us know.  Before reporting any curriculum errors, please make sure you have the same versions of Ruby, Rails, Gems, etc installed as the curriculum and students are using.
> 
> INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS:
> Install instructions can be found here:
> http://www.wiki.devchix.com/index.php?title=Workshop_Installation_Notes_Rails_3
> For those of you coming Friday night to help with the Installfest, please look these over.
> 
> TEACHING RESOURCES:
> This page contains really helpful progression of ideas for first time teachers, or teachers teaching first time students:  
> http://www.wiki.devchix.com/index.php?title=Workshop_Topics
> All of the Railsbridge resources can be found here:

Please contact Kelly or myself if you have any questions about the resources here, and if you've never used slides from Github, please to check out the slides ahead of time to familiarize yourself with how that works.
