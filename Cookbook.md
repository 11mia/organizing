There are a lot of different ways to organize a workshop, but if you've got the [[Minimum Viable Workshop]], you'll have a great time. There are way more people in the world who are excited to teach and learn Rails and Ruby than you know.

The [[Workshop Planning Timeline]] is a good place to start; it's divided into sections before, during, and after the workshop. There are *a lot* of individual tasks, so we recommend organizing in a team.

The [[Finding space, sponsors, volunteers, and students]] section is a little bit lighter than we'd like it to be, but since this cookbook's main authors are in San Francisco, most of the up-front work of finding those things is taken care of by the SF meta-organizers. So if you are a non-SF organizer, please help us beef up that section with your suggestions!

We have a lot of past organizers who can help you figure out what to do. Email organizing@railsbridge.org and we'll introduce you to an organizing mentor!
