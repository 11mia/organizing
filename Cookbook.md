If you're reading this Cookbook, you may be _thinking about_ organizing, or you may be diving into organizing for the first time. Welcome!

Find a quiet hour to read through the entire Cookbook. There is gold (or avocado, or wild blackberries, to extend the metaphor) here to help make your first time as sane and fun as possible.
