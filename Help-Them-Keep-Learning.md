## How to Help Attendees Keep Learning

### Just one weekend is not enough, of course.

Installing Clojure stuff on Friday, leaning Clojure basics on Saturday, then she's good to go to become a Clojure developer?
Except a very few cases, of course, the answer is no.
As many of you suspect, just one weekend is not enough to start coding Clojure; moreover, it's not enough to keep coding Clojure.
This document is for ClojureBridge volunteers to help workshop attendees further after the workshop.


### Tell them or invite them local Clojure events

It may be true high profile Clojure developers in the area present at the ClojureBridge workshop.
In such a case, please tell them or invite them to the event.
It depends on a programming background, but just listening to a Clojure talk would not directly improve her Clojure skill.
Don't disappoint. The point is to expose them to Clojure technology and community.
If the speaker at the event is a coach or TA at the workshop, she may not hesitate to go to the event.
Suppose some of the attendees come to the local event, it means they have made the great first step.


### Organize follow-up workshop or event

It is a good idea to organize the follow-up workshop or event.
This may be a short, one or two hours, event like a meetup we do often.
During the follow-up event, walking through ClojureBridge curriculum with additional materials would be good.
Either lecture style or hack night style will help attendees to keep learning.
If some folks start coding a little, starting some project may be an idea, for example, quil app of their own.
Since this sort of short event is easy to organize, we can have often.
Organize the events not just once.


### Give them local meetups and/or community info

Since ClojureBridge workshop is driven by a community in the area, we can assume there is also a local Clojure community in the area.
Give ClojureBridge attendees local community info, upcoming events or whatever they can join.
When you give the info, it's a good idea to hand them a piece of paper.
Many of attendees are not familiar with the word, community, or meetup.com, github.com, etc.
If you just show or say urls of those, they may miss the info.
