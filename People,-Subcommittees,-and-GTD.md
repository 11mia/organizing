RailsBridge likes to play things fast and loose. Therefore, we don't have a lot of formal organizational structures. If you're wondering who to talk to about stuff regarding RailsBridge, this is something of a starting place. Most of these folks are located in the Bay Area unless marked otherwise. 

Please join & send any questions to the [workshop organizer's listserve/Google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/railsbridge-workshops). We all like being in the loop, and those that don't subscribe to the daily digest :D

(All of these lists after the first three might be horrifically incomplete; edit away!)

### The Board
RailsBridge has a three person board consisting of its two founders, the Sarahs, and Austin Puman, an early volunteer and knower-of-things related to non-profit financials.
* Sarah Allen, president (sarah (at) ultrasaurus (dot) com)
* Sarah Mei, secretary (sarah mei (at) gmail (dot) com)
* Austin Putman, treasurer (austinfromboston (at) gmail (dot) com)

### The person who handles the money
Austin can hook you up when it comes to workshop expenses. You do need to talk to him about your workshop and what you plan to spend in advance, but then he can get you paid back or find someone else to pick up the bill. 
* Austin Putman

### SF Workshops Coordinators
Rachel & Lillie scout out venues in advance and introduce organizers and their mentors to venue folks. They also do as much emailing and cheering as necessary to get workshops to happen. 
* Rachel Myers (rachel.marie.myers (at) gmail (dot) com)
