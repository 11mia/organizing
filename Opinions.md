Lillie Chilen says:
* Don't be a hero. Delegation is hard for some people, but if you don't delegate, your head might pop off your body. Ask for help.
* Most of the volunteers will be teachers, so unless you recruit dedicated non-teaching volunteers, prepare to lasso some volunteers and get them to help with whatever needs doing.
