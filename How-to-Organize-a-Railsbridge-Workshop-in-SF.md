## Confirm dates & details with the hosting venue
The Railsbridge meta-organizers have introduced you via email to the contact person at the hosting venue. You'll want to confirm that the dates still work for them, how much room they have (which you will use to guide the RSVP cap on Meetup), and lots of other details. So many, in fact, that we have a whole separate page for what to talk about: [[hosting venue questions|hosting venue questions]].
